A research project done in R for a Regression Analysis class focused on predicting the average length of stay of patients in a hospital based upon age and infection risk. The model used multiple linear regression and we tested multiple other predictors to see if adding them to the analysis would be helpful. 

Used car and dplyr

Created and analyzed graph grids and histograms
Found variable inflation factor
Performed variable selection ussing Partial R^2 and comparing F Statistics
Ran Shapiro-Wilkes test, Cook's distance, found leverage, and studentized residuals.

The project could have been improved with a linear relationship in the data, as the dataset had to be assumed as linear despite nonlinearity.
